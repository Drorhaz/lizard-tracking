# Real-Time Lizard Tracking — Head Detection

This repo contains the code and assets for **real-time lizard head detection** using YOLO (v11 small) and the project workflow described in the initial report.

## 🏆 **Current Results**
- **Model**: YOLOv11s (9.4M parameters)
- **Best Performance**: **98.3% mAP@0.5** (CPU training, 3 epochs)
- **Dataset**: 2,974 labeled images (thermal + visible)
- **Status**: ✅ Dataset validated, ready for production CUDA training

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: MPS Training Issue**

**DO NOT use MPS (Apple GPU) for YOLO training on macOS!**

We discovered a PyTorch MPS backend bug that causes **silent training failure**:
- ❌ Training appears successful but **all losses stay at 0**
- ❌ **All metrics remain at 0** (mAP, Recall, Precision)  
- ❌ **No learning occurs** despite completing epochs
- ❌ Model files are created but **contain no learned features**

### ✅ **Confirmed Solutions**
- **Development**: Use `device='cpu'` (slower but works perfectly)
- **Production**: Use CUDA GPU (Google Colab, Kaggle) 
- **Always run sanity check first**: `python3 train_sanity.py`

### 📊 **Training Results Comparison**
| Training Run | Device | Epochs | Duration | mAP@0.5 | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| MPS Training | MPS (M1) | 10 | 43 min | **0.000** | ❌ Failed (backend bug) |
| CPU Sanity | CPU (M1) | 3 | 50 min | **0.983** | ✅ **Success** |
| Production | CUDA | TBD | TBD | TBD | 🔄 Planned |

## Quick Start

### 0) Install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # or use your preferred env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1) Dataset (YOLO format)
```
dataset/
  images/{train,val,test}/
  labels/{train,val,test}/
```
> The `dataset/` folder is **gitignored**. Keep your data local or mount in Colab/remote.

### 2) Sanity training (CPU on Mac)
Run a tiny training pass to verify learning works:
```bash
python tools/train_sanity.py
```
**Expected:** non-zero losses; validation metrics > 0 in `runs/detect/.../results.csv`.

### 3) Full training (CUDA / Colab / remote)
Once sanity passes, run the long training on a CUDA GPU:
```bash
python train_full.py --device 0 --epochs 60 --batch auto
```
This will create a `runs/detect/...` folder with `weights/best.pt` and training plots.

### 4) Inference & FPS check
After training, run inference + latency profiling:
```bash
python tools/bench_infer.py --weights runs/detect/<RUN>/weights/best.pt --images dataset/images/val
```

```

## 📊 **Training Documentation & Results**

Detailed training documentation and results are available:
- **[Training Log](docs/training_log.md)** - Complete training history and analysis
- **[Training Results Summary](TRAINING_RESULTS.md)** - Performance comparison table
- **[Experiments](experiments/)** - Organized results by training run:
  - `sanity_check_cpu/` - Successful CPU training (98.3% mAP)
  - `mps_failed/` - Failed MPS training documentation

## Known issues
- **MPS training on Mac:** Confirmed silent failure → always run `train_sanity.py` on CPU first.
- **Large files:** Don't commit datasets or weights (`*.pt`); use Git LFS if needed.
