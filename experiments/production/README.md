# Production Training - CUDA GPU (Planned)

## Status: ðŸ”„ **PLANNED**

This folder will contain results from full production training on CUDA GPU.

## Expected Configuration
```yaml
data: configs/pogona_head.yaml
epochs: 50-80
imgsz: 640
batch: 16-32  # Larger batch on GPU
device: cuda
optimizer: AdamW
lr0: 0.001
patience: 15
augment: true
```

## Target Metrics
Based on CPU sanity check results (98.3% mAP@0.5 in 3 epochs), we expect production training to achieve:

- **mAP@0.5**: 95-99%
- **mAP@0.5-0.95**: 70-80%  
- **Precision**: >95%
- **Recall**: >95%
- **Inference Speed**: <100ms on GPU

## Planned Platform
- Google Colab Pro (NVIDIA A100/V100)
- Kaggle Notebooks (NVIDIA P100/T4)
- Or dedicated CUDA cloud instance

## Timeline
- Upload dataset: TBD
- Start training: TBD  
- Expected duration: 2-4 hours
- Results documentation: TBD
