- **Consistent Improvement**: All metrics improved across epochs
- **Stable Training**: No signs of overfitting or instability
- **Loss Reduction**: All loss components decreased smoothly

## Dataset Validation
The successful training confirms:
- ✅ High-quality labels (98.3% mAP achievable)
- ✅ Proper YOLO format annotations  
- ✅ Good train/validation split
- ✅ Sufficient dataset size (2,974 images)
- ✅ Mixed thermal/visible data works well

## Key Findings

### 1. **Dataset Quality Excellent**
Achieving 98.3% mAP@0.5 in just 3 epochs indicates:
- Very clean, accurate annotations
- Good representation of lizard head variations
- Proper balance between thermal and visible images

### 2. **Model Architecture Suitable**
YOLOv11s proves ideal for this task:
- Sufficient capacity for single-class detection
- Good balance of speed vs accuracy
- Handles multi-modal data (thermal + visible) well

### 3. **Training Configuration Optimal**
The hyperparameters work well:
- Learning rate (0.001) appropriate
- Batch size (8) suitable for dataset
- AdamW optimizer effective

## Comparison with Failed MPS Training
